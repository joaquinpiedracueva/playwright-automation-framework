## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by opening an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joaquinpiedracueva/playwright-juiceshop/issues).

Since this is a test automation framework and does not handle user data or run in production, most security concerns are low risk. However, all reports are appreciated and will be reviewed.
